1. Security Primitive:
- Secure hosts:
-- Password based auth disabled
-- SSH hosts enabled 

- Secure K8S:
-- Control access to Kube-API server:
--- Authentication
--- Authorization - RBAC, Node, ABAC, Webhook
--- TLS encryption
--- Network Policies


- KubeAPIServer Authentication process:
-- How: Site token static file (Not recommended)
-- Certificates
-- Identity Service


2. TLS:
-- Role: Making sure the Server identity as promised & encrypt the communication
-- How: Holding certificate (The Key) in Client & Server side, to decrypt the data (Symmetric encryption).
-- Asymmetric Key - Using private key & public Lock (Public key).
-- ssh-keygen - generates ```id_rsa``` (private key) & ```id_rsa.pub``` (public lock/key)
-- Asymmetric encryption sending first the public lock to the client, 
and the client response with the private key + public lock together, so middleman could never get the private key.
-- Generating the public lock via HTTPS:
--- openssl genrsa -out my_private_key.key  1024 (generate private key)
--- openssl rsa -in my_private_key.key -pubout > my_public_lock.pem
-- CA - Certificate Authority tell us who right the certificate, and prevent us from malicious
self managed certificates can be generated by hackers.
--- mTLS - mutual TLS both client & server side certified authority.

-- PKI - Public Key Infrastructure - The process of generating, distributing and managing 
Private & Public keys. 
-- Private key - Encrypt Data
-- Public & Private key - Decrypt Data

-- Public Lock/Key files - server.crt, server.pem, client.crt, client.pem
-- Private Key files - server.key, server-key.pem, client.key, client-key.pem


3. TLS in K8S:
- Requirements:
[] Server to Server Certificates (K8S components)
[] Client to Server Certificates
- K8S component Convention example
[] apiserver.crt
[] apiserver.key
[] etcdserver.crt
[] etcdserver.key
[] kubelete.crt
[] kubelete.key
- K8S clients Convention example:
[] admin.crt
[] admin.key
[] scheduler.crt
[] scheduler.key
[] kubeproxy.crt
[] kubeproxy.key
[] kubecontroller-manager.crt
[] kubecontroller-manager.key
[] kubelete-client.crt
[] kubelete-client.key
- CA:
[] ca.crt
[] ca.key
